Before my free subscription runs out, I'm collecting all the challenges I solved within the Java Developer path of JetBrains Academy/Hyperskill. There must be something like more than a thousand. Some of the topics are still missing, but I intend to add all the missing challenges before the end of the year. 

Initially my goal was to complete all of the topics of the Java Developer path as well as all of the problems, but as they kept including more and more content, it kept getting more and more difficult to achieve that goal :-D

Topics included:

- Basic syntax;
- Collections;
- Design patterns;
- Essential standard classes;
- Exception handling;
- File processing;
- Functional programming;
- Generics;
- Implementation of basic algorithms;
- IOStreams;
- Logging;
- Multithreading;
- Objected-oriented programming;
- Regular expressions;
- Swing;
- Testing tools and libraries;
